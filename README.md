# VCS Database Analysis

This branch of the Biodomain data analysis repository concerns all use and analysis of VCS project data. Note that the final outputs from this work will be published as part of the MyMaps VCS web apps (when using highly spatial data - e.g. polygons of project areas), or the Power BI web app.
